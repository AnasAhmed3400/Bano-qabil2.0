Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area, being the second largest in South Asia. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the northwest by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor.

    <h1>History of Pakistan</h1>
    <p>
        The history of Pakistan preceding the country's independence in 1947 is shared with that of Afghanistan, India, and Iran. Spanning the western expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern borderlands of the Iranian plateau, the region of present-day Pakistan served both as the fertile ground of a major civilization and as the gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East. <br>

        WHAT QUID-E-AZAM THINKS ABOUT PALESTINE AND ISRAEL :

        <blockquote>"Discussions on the Palestine issue are perpetual in Pakistan given the current Ramadan bombing and settler violence by the Israelis, Human Rights Watch declaring Israel’s policies crimes of apartheid, and the flirtation of part of Pakistan’s press with the idea of the country recognising Israel. Pakistanis frequently appeal to the role model of the country’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah for future decisions. History, however, tends to get lost in this, being replaced by half-truths and obfuscations. It is Jinnah’s conduct towards the Palestine issue to which we turn." </blockquote>

    <h1>Culture of Pakistan </h1>
    <p>The Culture of Pakistan (Urdu: پاکستانی ثقافت Pākistāni S̱aqāfat) is based in the Indo-Persian cultural matrix that constitutes a foundation plank of South Asian Muslim identity.[1] The region has formed a distinct cultural unit within the main cultural complex of South Asia, Middle East and Central Asia.[2][3] There are differences in culture among the different ethnic groups in matters such as dress, food, and religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices.</p>

    <h1>Geographical location OF PAKISTAN</h1>
    <P>
        The Geography of Pakistan (Urdu: جغرافیۂ پاکِستان) encompasses a wide variety of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean in the south to the mountains of the Karakoram, Hindukush, Himalayas ranges in the north. Pakistan geologically overlaps both with the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates where its Sindh and Punjab provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while Balochistan and most of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the Iranian Plateau.
